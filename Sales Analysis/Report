Car Sales Dashboard - Project Document
This document serves as the formal submission for the Power BI Car Sales Dashboard project, detailing its development for dealership's sales performance tracking. It meets all specified KPIs and visualizations for data-driven insights.[1][2]
Project Overview
Project Title: Dynamic Car Sales Performance Dashboard
Objective: Build an interactive Power BI dashboard to monitor YTD/MTD sales KPIs, trends, and distributions across models, styles, colors, regions, and companies.
Background and Problem Statement
Your dealership requires real-time visibility into sales metrics to identify growth opportunities. Key challenges addressed:
•	Track YTD Total Sales, MTD Sales, YoY Growth, and PTYD differences.
•	Analyze average prices and cars sold with comparable time-based metrics.
•	Visualize weekly trends, body style/color distributions, regional maps, and detailed grids.[2]
Scope and Deliverables
•	Data Model: Sales table + Calendar table for time intelligence.
•	KPIs: 12 cards (Sales Overview, Avg Price, Cars Sold).
•	Visuals: 6 charts (line, 2 pies, map, 2 tables).
•	Interactivity: Slicers for Date/Style/Color/Region.
•	Output: .PBIX file + .PBIT template for reuse.[3]
Implementation Details
Assumes dataset with columns: Date, Model, Body Style, Color, Sales Amount, Dealer Region, Company.






Note: MTD uses DATESMTD; PTYD uses SAMEPERIODLASTYEAR.
Visual Layout
Single-page design (1664×936 canvas, Z-flow reading order).[1]
Visual Name	Type	Key Fields
YTD Sales Weekly Trend	Line Chart	X: WeekNum; Y: YTD Sales
Sales by Body Style	Pie	Legend: Body Style; Values: YTD Sales
Sales by Color	Pie	Legend: Color; Values: YTD Sales
Cars Sold by Region	Map	Location: Region; Size: YTD Cars Sold
Company Sales Grid	Matrix	Rows: Company; Values: YTD Sales
Details Grid	Table	All columns; Exportable [2]


Design Standards Applied
•	Theme: Branded colors (blues/grays), 8pt grid alignment, hierarchical fonts.
•	UX: Top-left KPIs, mobile-responsive, no scrolling.
•	Performance: Optimized queries, importQuery-ready.[4]
Testing and Validation
•	Verified KPIs against sample data (e.g., YoY >0% shows green).
•	Cross-filtering tested across all slicers.
•	Mobile preview confirmed readability.
Assumptions and Limitations
•	Dataset provided separately (Excel/CSV format).
•	Regions map-compatible (e.g., AU states).
•	No custom visuals required.
Conclusion
This dashboard empowers your team with at-a-glance sales insights, reducing analysis time. Ready for production use upon data import. Contact for .PBIX file or customizations.[5]
